This directory contains sripts that can create clusters loaded with
benchmarking data reproducibly.  Since large benchmark datasets can take a lot
of time to load, they try to reuse existing clusters if they are compatible
with the current PostgreSQL build's catversion.

Cluster recipes should expect to be run with pg_sisyphus as the present
working directory.  They should respect the SISYPHUS_CLUSTERS environment
variable, defaulting to "clusters" if it's not set, and create a subdirectory
under there, with further per-catversion subdirectories.  If they find that
the current catversion already exists, they should do nothing.  They should
work in a way that doesn't leave a broken installation if they fail part-way
through.  They should expect PATH to contain a PostgreSQL installation.
